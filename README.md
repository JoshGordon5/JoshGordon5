### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior software developer who holds a degree in Web and Mobile Development from UWS. 

Currently working as an IT support technician for a tech consultancy in London while learning as many skills and gaining as many certifications as possible. 

You will see a wide variety of technologies and languages popping on the repos that I make public as I love to learn and play around with as much as possible.

My main focuses currently are learning to technically write and finish projects to completion - this is a bad habit of mine! Coding can be difficult and dishearting but hey, always remember - This Too Shall Pass!
